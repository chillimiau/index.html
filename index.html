    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        I’m Joanna Romero, a Chilean native with a deep understanding of U.S. culture, shaped by 16 years of life in Chicago—from 1992 to 2008. During those formative years, I studied, worked, built meaningful relationships, and fully embraced the American lifestyle.
    </p>
    <p>
        After returning to Chile at 27, I explored diverse cities across the country and traveled throughout South America before spending a decade in an international corporation, where I was consistently recognized for my contributions and commitment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, as an independent consultant, I combine international experience with deep local insight to support expatriates and investors in Chile—going far beyond language assistance to provide meaningful, personalized guidance.
